# Ideas

theme: SECRETS

## game inspirations

- vampire survivors
  - levelling up weapons
  - simple 2 frame animation style, but not pixel art?
- binding of issac
  - dungeon crawler, room based
- zelda
  - in dungeons **secret** areas can be opened by bombing walls
  - opening chest to reveal the **secret** item
- Rick Dangerous https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDmJNcYLbuQ

## mechanics i want

- dungeon crawler
- **secret** areas, via bomb
- a skill tree or shop, ie gain currency or exp and spend it for power ups
- doors and keys type mechanic
- boss battles
- mobile compatible control method (if possible)
- speedrun (so timed) with levelled up tree

## game storyline ideas

- quest for **secret** item, Indiana Jones style quest for holy grale / crystal skull type item, perhaps issac type dungeon game with egyptian theme level, mobs and weapons. the **secret** inside the pyramid or osiris shaft? https://www.youtube.com/shorts/8tTSVZvXAfE
- collecting fragments of **secret** message / audio message (credits Sam via chatgpt)
- original (?) cat game idea: you're playing as cat who sees "missing cat" posters and starts investigating the dissapearances (this is not necessarily the dungeon crawler idea) - Abe's Odyssey type horror mystery storyline ("they" are secretly using the cat meat as cat food?) soilent green

## tools i want to use
